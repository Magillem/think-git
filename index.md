- Free and open source
- Easy to learn

# A brief history of Git

## 

- `git` is British English slang for "unpleasant person". (Linus Torvalds likes to name things after himself.)
- Development began in 2005 because Linus wanted a distributed system that was fast and efficient.

# So really, what is Git?

## 

- Git is different. Forget everything you know about Subversion
- Data is a stream of snapshots
